# MySQLJavaHalo

MySQLJavaHalo is a project made by 4 of my colleague students and me in the first year of my study on The Hague University.
The first part of the application is meant to help teachers test primary school students their health condition by letting the students
do an agility course and timing each one of them how fast they finish the course. The second part is meant to help researchers 
get anonymous data from each class for statistical purposes about the health condition of students.
