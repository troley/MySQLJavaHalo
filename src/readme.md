# HALO application

This application is created by the following students in order by the HALO of The Hague University of Applied Sciences:

  - Gianfranco Lopez (15102211)

  - Len van Kampen (14063711)

For this school project we have developed an application which can track the main motoric skills from students at elementary school and the high school. The main goal of this application is to avoid a motoric arrear by these children. This project is dedicated by teachers from the HALO (The Hague Academic of Physical education).

This application contains two main functionalities. The first one is for the researchers and the second one is for the teachers who have to track their students. Both of those sides have their own requirements which are documented in our action plan. This application also focus on their users privacy which is very important to us and our clients.
